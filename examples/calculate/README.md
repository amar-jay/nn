Just a playaround with various feed forward neural network architectures to calculate numbers.
Architectures to try:
- [ ] Simple feedforward network
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- [ ] Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
- [ ] Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network
- [ ] Transformer-based model
